- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions. 
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions. 
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). 
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML. 
- Launch a functioning webpage via index.html

## HTML Page & Results

- Creation and deployment of JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.

## Limitations & Recommendations

One drawback or limitation of this webpage is that it is not very user friendly. Two recommendations can be made to improve the webpage:

- Filtering of the other available coulmns would provide the user with better interaction possibilities.

- Drop down menus for input would make the search function more dynamic.
